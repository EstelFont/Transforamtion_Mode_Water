# Transforamtion_Mode_Water

This repository contains several notebooks to process and produce the figures from Font et al. (in review) - Spatiotemporal scales of mode water transformation in the Sea of Oman in Ocean Sciences - EGU

## Repository content and output for the different notebooks:
00: Run the WMT algorithm to Argo Floats Climatology
00: Run the WMT algorithm to the glider transects in sigma-spice and T-S space. Figure S2
01: Figure 1 & S1
02: Figure 2 & 3
03: Figure 4
04: Figure 5

## Data availability and supplementary software:
The Argo data used in this study is available by the International Argo Program and the national programs contributing to it for the domain 40–80 °E, -5–30 °N and between 2000-2023 (Argo, 2023). The MOM4p1-TOPAZ potential temperature, salinity, and oxygen data used in this study for the upper 250m and domain 35-80 °E, 0-30 °N, are available from Zenodo (Font & Vinaychandran, 2025). Bathymetry data is available by GEBCOCompilation Group (GEBCO, 2023).
